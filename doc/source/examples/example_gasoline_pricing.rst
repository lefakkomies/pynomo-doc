Gasoline Price comparison
============================

Background
---------------------

Comparing the unit price of a commodity with different units of measure and currencies is greatly simplified with a nomograph.  In this example cross border travellers between the United States and Canada can easily compare the cost of gasoline on both sides of the border.  Moreover, by drawing an isopleth thorough the currency rate at par (1.0000) they can directly convert dollars per litre to dollars per USG.  This nomograph implements the following formula:

:Math:`\frac{CAD}{L} = \frac{US Gal}{L} \times \frac{CAD}{USD} \times \frac{USD}{US Gal}`
